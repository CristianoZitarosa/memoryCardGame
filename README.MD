![screenshot](media/screenshot.PNG)
### Fend Nanodegree - Web Programming with Javascript Module

Create a Memory Card Game with 16 cards, a score panel showing player's rating, moves, time. At the end of the game a message will pop up to recap player's performance.
The player can restart the game anytime or play it again at the end.

### New skills applied from the Module:
* Javascript;
### Required:
All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
### Additional features:
* There are 23 different cards.
* The array is shuffled a first time, then it is used the .slice() method to extract 8 of them.
* Finally it is used the .concat() method to double the array and it is shuffled again.
